# Easycoding

[Easycoding](https://easy-coding.netlify.app/) (click link to live website) was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is deployed on Netlify.
This project was built from scratch in 1 week.

## What is Easycoding about?

This is an app created for developers that want to understand EASILY how to implement a new feature or dependency. Through this app a user can upload some post to help others code in the easiest possible way, or even request a matter that they have trouble with, so eventually an other user can see it and post something about that. So it is a platform where all developers can share their experience with features that they were struggling in the beginning, and now found a much easier way to implement them. Furthermore, Easycoding let you share you feeling about a post or request with the comment section. For example, a user can refer to a post if he/she thinks that it is not as helpful, or if it actually is, give some nice feedback to the author of the post. So let's all join this website and make our coding lives easy, by helping each other in this journey. We definitely invite you to sign up and try it out.

## What does it look like?
